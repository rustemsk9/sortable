Let me examine your `Paginator.js` and check how it interacts with other components to understand the asynchronous behavior you're experiencing.

Read [](file:///Users/Guest/Downloads/sortable/web/src/views/HomeView.js#201-201), lines 201 to 305

Now let me check how the paginator is initialized and how it interacts with the HomeView:

Read [](file:///Users/Guest/Downloads/sortable/web/index.js#51-51), lines 51 to 158

Now I can see the issue! The problem is in the initialization order and timing. Here are the main issues I found:

## Issues with your Paginator.js:

1. **Race Condition**: The HomeView and Paginator are initialized separately and asynchronously, but they depend on each other. The HomeView tries to set up paginator callbacks __before the paginator might be fully initialized.__

2. **Callback Setup Timing**: In `HomeView.setupComponentCallbacks()`, it's trying to access `window.currentPaginatorView` which might not be ready yet.

3. **State Synchronization**: The paginator's internal state can get out of sync with the HomeView's state.

Let me check the paginator HTML structure: 

Now I'll provide a fix. The main issue is the race condition between HomeView and Paginator initialization. Here's how to fix it: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```javascript
    async init() {
        #// Wait a bit to ensure DOM elements are ready
        #await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
        this.setupEventListeners();
        this.render();
        console.log("Paginator initialized");
        
        #// Notify Homeiew that paginator is ready
        #if (window.currentHmeView && typeof window.#currentHomeView.onPaginatorReady === 'faginatorReady` method should look like in HomeView: 
```
Searched text for `onPaginatorReady` (`**/*.js`), 4 results

The `onPaginatorReady` method is missing from HomeView. Let me add it: 

Using "Replace String in File"
```javascript
    // Set up callback for paginator (if already available)
    #this.setupPaginatorCallback();
  }

  // Called when paginator is ready
  #onPaginatorReady() {
    #this.setupPaginatorCallback();
    #this.updatePaginatorState();
  #}

  #setupPaginatorCallback() {
    const paginatorElement = document.querySelector('#paginator');
    if (paginatorElement && window.currentPaginatorView) {
      window.currentPaginatorView.setPageChangeCallback((page) => {
        this.handlePageChange(page);
      });
    }
  }
```
Now let's also fix a potential issue in the `handlePageChange` method to ensure proper synchronization: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```javascript
  #handlePageChange(page) {
    console.log(`Page change requested: ${page}`);
    this.currentPage = page;
    #this.renderTable();
    -this.updatePaginatorState();
    #// Don't call updatePaginatorState here to avoid circular updates
    #// The paginator already knows its own state
  }
```
Now let's fix a potential issue in the Paginator's `updatePagination` method to ensure it properly updates when called from HomeView: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```javascript

```
Let me also check if there are any missing parts in the Paginator.js file: 

Read [](file:///Users/Guest/Downloads/sortable/web/src/views/Paginator.js#40-40), lines 40 to 50

I need to see the complete setupEventListeners method to ensure it's properly implemented: 

Read [](file:///Users/Guest/Downloads/sortable/web/src/views/Paginator.js#32-32), lines 32 to 60

Perfect! The setupEventListeners method is complete. Now let me also update the HomeView's `updatePaginatorState` method to be more robust: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```javascript

```
## Summary of fixes made:

1. **Added proper callback setup timing**: Added `onPaginatorReady()` method to HomeView that gets called when the paginator is fully initialized.

2. **Fixed circular update issue**: Removed the `updatePaginatorState()` call from `handlePageChange()` to prevent infinite loops where the paginator updates itself.

3. **Enhanced error checking**: Added better validation in `updatePaginatorState()` to ensure the paginator exists and has the required method.

4. **Added debugging logs**: Added console.log statements to help track the flow of data between HomeView and Paginator.

5. **Improved state validation**: Enhanced the `updatePagination` method to ensure the current page stays within valid bounds.

## Key changes:

- **Race condition fixed**: The paginator now properly notifies HomeView when it's ready
- **Synchronous behavior**: The data flow is now more predictable and synchronous
- **Better error handling**: Added checks to prevent errors when components aren't ready

The main issue was that HomeView was trying to interact with the Paginator before it was fully initialized, causing asynchronous behavior and state synchronization problems. These changes ensure proper initialization order and reliable communication between the components.

Made changes.
