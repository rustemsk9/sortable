I'll help you add a notification system for data updates with an exclamation mark in the navbar. Let me first check the NavBarView structure to understand how to add this feature. 

Read [](file:///Users/Guest/Downloads/sortable/web/src/views/NavBarView.js#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Read [](file:///Users/Guest/Downloads/sortable/web/src/views/NavBarView.js#51-51), lines 51 to 158

Now I'll modify the NavBarView to add a notification indicator and update the `handleDataUpdate` function to show notifications instead of immediately refreshing.

Starting (1/3) *Add notification indicator to NavBar*

First, let's update the NavBarView to include a notification indicator: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let's add the CSS styles for the notification button: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let's update the NavBar class to include methods for showing/hiding the notification and add the event listener: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let's add the methods for handling the notification: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Starting (2/3) *Update handleDataUpdate function*

Now let's update the `handleDataUpdate` function in index.js to show the notification instead of immediately refreshing: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Starting (3/3) *Add refresh functionality to notification*

The click handler is already implemented in the NavBar. Let me also add a mobile-responsive style for the notification button: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Completed (3/3) *Add refresh functionality to notification*

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the notification system. Here's what I added:

## ✅ **Changes Made:**

### 1. **NavBar Notification Button**
- Added a notification button with an exclamation mark (!) in a red circle
- Button shows "Refresh Data" text (hidden on mobile for space)
- Animated with a pulsing effect to grab attention
- Hidden by default, only shows when data updates are detected

### 2. **Updated Data Update Handler**
- Changed `handleDataUpdate()` to show the notification instead of immediately refreshing
- Now displays a visual indicator that new data is available

### 3. **Click-to-Refresh Functionality**
- When the notification button is clicked, it:
  - Hides the notification
  - Triggers the data refresh in HomeView
  - Updates the table with new data

### 4. **Mobile Responsive**
- On mobile devices, only the exclamation mark shows (no text)
- Button becomes circular for better mobile UX

## **How it works:**

1. **Data Update Detected** → Shows notification button in navbar
2. **User Clicks Notification** → Refreshes data and hides notification
3. **Visual Feedback** → Pulsing animation draws user attention

The notification system provides better user control over when data refreshes happen, making the app feel less jarring and giving users a choice of when to update their view.

Made changes.
